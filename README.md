## List of projects

### Setup

Contains a json snippets to use inside VS Code to make React code faster.

### Pure React

This project helps to understand how a pure react app looks like.
This is not the way we would build apps normally, but it's a good way to understand how a pure react app works.

### JS Review

The project is just a recap of javascript code that would be necessary to know in order to use React.

### Pizza Menu

This project was built using the command `npx create-react-app my-app`.
This is an easy and powerful way to setup a React way, as everthying is already set up for us.
However, it is deprecated and should not be used to build real React apps.
It is a great tool to learn though.
